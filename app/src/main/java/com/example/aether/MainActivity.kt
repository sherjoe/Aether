package com.example.aether

/**
 * Aether - This app was supposed to replicate a basic photo sharing (Like Instagram) social media app where
 * users could share their dreams and accompany it with a photo. The photo could be
 * just where they woke up in a sweat or if they have a drawing from their image
 * gallery that they can upload to the feed.
 *
 * 1. Login ~ the user is expected to type hwk4@example.com as the email and abcdef as the password
 * 2. Feed ~ From there the user can either capture a dream or choose a dream
 * capturing a dream will enable the camera while choosing a dream will make them go to the gallery to choose an image
 * 3. ~ The Return - it will take a couple of seconds but they will be directed back to the live feed afterwards
 * 4. ~ Menu ~ The user can filter the dreams if their type specifically has "Nightmare" or "Lucid", or if they want to get
 * rid of those filters
 * 5. ~ Settings ~ The user can change the font size of any of the words that are not part of the feed.
 * In order to not mess with the feed layout cropping words, only the actvities without the feed will obey the text size configuration.
 * They can also switch the theme to dark mode.
 *6. ~ The user can also use the app in Spanish if they wish.
 *
 * Luny, the dream mascot of Aether, oversees everything.
